; Exercise 1.8
; 
; Newton's method for cube roots is based on the fact that if y is an 
; approximation to the cube root of x, then a better approximation is given by 
; the value
; 
; (x/y^2 + 2y)/3
; 
; Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the square-
; root procedure. (In Section 1.3.4 we will see how to implement Newtonâ€™s method
; in general as an abstraction of these square root and cube-root procedures.)

(define (square x) (* x x))

(define (cube-root x)
    (cube-root-iter 1.0 x))

(define (cube-root-iter guess x)
    (if (good-enough? guess x)
        guess
        (cube-root-iter (improve guess x) x)))

; From exercise 1.7
(define epsilon 1e-20)
(define (good-enough? guess x)
    (< (abs (- guess (improve guess x)))
        (* guess epsilon)))

(define (improve guess x)
    (/ (+ (/ x (square guess)) (* 2 guess)) 3))
