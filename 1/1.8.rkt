; Exercise 1.8

; Newton's method for cube roots is based on the fact that if y is an approximation
; to the cube root of x, then a better approximation is given by the value

; ((x / y^2 ) + 2y ) / 3

; Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the square-root
; procedure. (In Section 1.3.4 we will see how to implement Newtonâ€™s method in general as an
; abstraction of these square root and cube-root procedures.)

(define (cbrt-iter guess x)
  (if (good-enough? guess (improve guess x))
      guess
      (cbrt-iter (improve guess x)
                 x)))

(define (improve guess x)
  (/ (+  (/ x (* guess guess)) (* guess 2)) 3))


(define (good-enough? previous-guess guess)
  (< (abs (/ (- guess previous-guess) guess)) 0.0001))


; Reimplemented previous exercise with updated formula for improving
; cube root guesses
